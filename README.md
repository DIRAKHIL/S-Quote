## Development

### Architecture
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel architecture
- **ObservableObject**: State management
- **UserDefaults**: Local data persistence
- **Combine**: Reactive programming

### Key Components

#### Models
- `Event`: Client and event information
- `Quote`: Complete quotation with items and pricing
- `QuoteItem`: Individual service/product items

#### Services
- `QuoteService`: Business logic and data management
- Default items creation and management
- Quote export functionality

#### Views
- `ContentView`: Main split view interface
- `NewQuoteView`: Multi-step quote creation wizard
- `QuoteDetailView`: Quote viewing and editing

### Adding New Features

#### Adding New Service Categories
1. Update `ItemCategory` enum in `QuoteItem.swift`
2. Add icon and color properties
3. Update default items in `QuoteService.swift`

#### Adding New Export Formats
1. Extend `QuoteService.generateQuoteText()` method
2. Add new export options in `ExportQuoteView`
3. Implement format-specific generation logic

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -project "S Quote.xcodeproj" -scheme "S-Quote" -destination 'platform=macOS'

# Run specific test class
xcodebuild test -project "S Quote.xcodeproj" -scheme "S-Quote" -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:S_QuoteTests/QuoteServiceTests
```

### UI Tests
```bash
# Run UI tests
xcodebuild test -project "S Quote.xcodeproj" -scheme "S-Quote" -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:S_QuoteUITests
```

## Deployment

### Manual Release
1. Update version in project settings
2. Create git tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
3. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and create release

### Automated Deployment
The CI/CD pipeline automatically:
1. Builds the app on every push
2. Runs tests and static analysis
3. Creates DMG installer
4. Uploads artifacts to GitHub
5. Optionally uploads to S3 for distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

#### Code Signing
```bash
# Check signing identity
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Update provisioning profiles
# Xcode â†’ Preferences â†’ Accounts â†’ Download Manual Profiles
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Clean build folder
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# Clean project
xcodebuild clean -project "S Quote.xcodeproj" -scheme "S-Quote"
```

#### Scheme Issues
```bash
# List available schemes
xcodebuild -list -project "S Quote.xcodeproj"

# Ensure scheme is shared
# Xcode â†’ Product â†’ Scheme â†’ Manage Schemes â†’ Check "Shared"
```

### Runtime Issues

#### Data Persistence
- Data is stored in UserDefaults
- Location: `~/Library/Preferences/DIR.S-Quote.plist`
- Reset: Delete the plist file to clear all data

#### Performance
- Large quote lists may impact performance
- Consider implementing Core Data for production use
- Optimize image assets for better memory usage
