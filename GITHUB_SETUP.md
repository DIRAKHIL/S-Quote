2. Edit your token to include the `workflow` scope
3. Add the workflow file manually

### Option 2: Manual Workflow Creation
Create `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` with this content:

```yaml
name: Build macOS App

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  release:
    types: [ created ]

env:
  XCODE_VERSION: '16.4'
  MACOS_VERSION: '15.5'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-15
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup Xcode
      uses: maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1
      with:
        xcode-version: ${{ env.XCODE_VERSION }}
        
    - name: Run build script
      run: ./build.sh --skip-tests
      
    - name: Upload artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: S-Quote-macOS-${{ github.sha }}
        path: |
